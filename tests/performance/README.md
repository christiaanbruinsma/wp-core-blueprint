# BASE-V1-F3A performance + query-source attribution harness

This harness extends the F2 observation baseline with opt-in query tracing for the rendered logged-in operator frontend. The purpose is to identify where measured Base query overhead originates before any production optimization is considered.

It measures twelve isolated requests in one temporary WordPress installation.

**Before Base activation (WordPress-only controls):**

- anonymous frontend;
- logged-in administrator frontend;
- logged-in administrator frontend with the footer/render phase executed and query tracing enabled;
- generic WordPress admin dashboard.

**After Base activation:**

- anonymous frontend;
- logged-in operator frontend (and verifies the user has `cb_core_hud_use`);
- logged-in operator frontend with the footer/HUD render phase executed and query tracing enabled;
- generic WordPress admin dashboard;
- Core Blueprint Dashboard;
- Logs;
- Reports;
- Safeguards.

Every normal scenario emits JSON with request memory, query count, classic/script-module asset counts, Core Blueprint local asset bytes, the WordPress autoload footprint and scheduled Core Blueprint cron hooks/events. Records include whether Base was active, whether the request was authenticated, whether query tracing was enabled and whether the footer/render phase was executed.

`baseline.json` contains four direct control → Base comparisons:

- `anonymous_frontend`: WordPress-only anonymous frontend → Base-enabled anonymous frontend;
- `operator_frontend`: WordPress-only logged-in frontend → Base-enabled logged-in operator frontend;
- `operator_frontend_rendered`: the same comparison with `wp_footer` executed so actual HUD rendering is included;
- `generic_admin`: WordPress-only admin dashboard → Base-enabled generic admin dashboard.

## F3A query trace

Only the rendered operator pair enables `SAVEQUERIES`. It is enabled through `tests/performance/query-trace-prepend.php`, loaded with PHP `auto_prepend_file`, so WordPress query collection starts before `wp-settings.php` boots without changing production code or the normal request harness.

The temporary MU performance guard records query-count boundaries at:

1. `wp_loaded` — end of WordPress/Base bootstrap for this harness;
2. `wp` — after the frontend main-query/routing phase;
3. `wp_enqueue_scripts` — after enqueue/capability gating;
4. `wp_footer` — after the real footer/HUD render phase.

The raw query traces are stored under `query-traces/` in the CI artifact. Each trace entry contains:

- sequential query index;
- attributed phase (`bootstrap`, `wp`, `enqueue`, `render`);
- whitespace-normalized SQL;
- WordPress `SAVEQUERIES` caller string;
- query duration.

`baseline.json` also contains `query_attribution`, with per-phase control/Base counts and a multiset difference of Base-extra and control-only queries. The difference key is phase + normalized SQL; the Base-side caller is retained for each unmatched query so the source can be inspected directly.

These data remain **diagnostic observations only**. F3A introduces no numeric performance budgets and changes no production code.

Run through `tests/bin/run-performance-baseline.sh` after `tests/bin/install-wp-tests.sh` has prepared the pinned WordPress runtime. Results are written to `CB_PERFORMANCE_RESULTS_DIR` when set, otherwise to the system temporary directory. CI uploads the complete directory for every supported WP/PHP lane.
