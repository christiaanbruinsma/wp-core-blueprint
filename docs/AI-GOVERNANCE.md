# AI Governance

Core Blueprint Base owns the canonical governance evidence boundary for WordPress abilities, agents and machine integrations.

AI Governance is **not** an AI provider, chat interface, agent runtime or policy engine. Its v1 responsibility is evidence, observability, retention and audit export.

## Governing principles

### Evidence over inference

Unknown attribution is valid evidence.

Core Blueprint does not infer that:

- an Ability invocation came from AI;
- a REST request came from MCP;
- an MCP request came from a specific provider, model or client;
- an operation was approved unless an integration supplies reliable approval evidence.

The automatic WordPress Abilities observer records the execution facts WordPress exposes. Source identity is populated only when a concrete integration/request boundary supports it.

### Metadata first

Automatic Ability capture does not retain raw Ability inputs or outputs.

It records bounded metadata such as:

- value type;
- string byte length;
- array item count;
- object class;
- `WP_Error` codes;
- operation/Ability identity;
- actor identity where WordPress provides one;
- source/transport evidence where reliably known;
- outcome and capture state;
- duration;
- bounded structured evidence/context.

Raw prompts, responses, request bodies, authorization material, cookies and secret-bearing fields are not part of the automatic evidence model.

Consumer-reported context passes through the AI Governance privacy boundary and Base's canonical governance sanitizer/redactor before storage.

## Canonical datastore

Base owns the dedicated table:

`{$wpdb->prefix}cb_core_ai_activity`

The store has its own schema marker:

`cb_core_ai_activity_db_version`

This schema is intentionally independent from `CB_CORE_DB_VERSION`. The existing global Base DB marker remains the audit-log schema marker and is not bumped merely because AI Activity adds a dedicated governed store.

AI Activity is registered with Base's `RetentionStoreRegistry` and is pruned by the canonical daily retention runner.

Default retention is 365 days. `0` means retain indefinitely.

## Evidence model

Each activity has a stable opaque UUID plus these first-class dimensions:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `actor_user_id`, `actor_user_login` | Current WordPress actor where available. Base resolves this itself. |
| `operation_type` | `ability` for automatic WordPress Ability evidence, `operation` for consumer-reported activity. |
| `operation` | Stable Ability/operation identifier. |
| `transport` | Observed execution boundary such as `php`, `rest`, `cli`, `mcp-http`, `mcp-stdio`, or `reported`. |
| `source_id`, `source_label` | Integration/source only when reliably attributed; otherwise null. |
| `outcome` | What is known about the terminal result: `unknown`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `denied`, `invalid`, `short-circuited`. |
| `capture_state` | Strongest lifecycle evidence observed for that record. |
| `target_*` | Optional target metadata supplied by a trusted consumer/integration. |
| `duration_ms` | Measured duration where a start and terminal boundary are both observable. |
| `error_code` | Bounded machine-readable error code when available. |
| `evidence` | Bounded structured capture evidence. |
| `context` | Bounded structured consumer context. |
| `created_at`, `completed_at` | Observation and terminal timestamps. |

`outcome` and `capture_state` are intentionally separate. A record can therefore truthfully say that execution passed authorization on WordPress 7.0 while the final outcome remains unknown because that WordPress version exposes no common callback-result hook for a failed execution.

## WordPress Abilities capture matrix

### WordPress 7.0

The common platform actions available to Base are:

- `wp_before_execute_ability` — after input validation and permission checks pass;
- `wp_after_execute_ability` — after successful execution and output validation.

Base can therefore prove:

- authorized execution start;
- successful completion;
- actor/source/transport evidence available at those boundaries;
- elapsed duration for successful calls.

Through the common 7.0 actions alone Base cannot globally prove:

- raw invocation attempts that fail before authorization;
- permission denials;
- input-validation failures;
- callback `WP_Error` outcomes;
- output-validation failures;
- pre-execution short-circuits (the common short-circuit filter is a WordPress 7.1 addition).

A 7.0 Ability that passed authorization but returned before the success action therefore remains `outcome=unknown` with its strongest observed `capture_state` rather than being guessed as failed.

### WordPress 7.1

Base additionally observes the official 7.1 lifecycle surface:

- `wp_ability_invoked`;
- `wp_pre_execute_ability`;
- `wp_ability_normalize_input`;
- `wp_ability_validate_input`;
- `wp_ability_permission_result`;
- `wp_ability_execute_result`;
- `wp_ability_validate_output`;
- plus the existing before/after actions.

This permits broader evidence for:

- every Ability invocation attempt;
- invalid/normalization failures;
- permission denial;
- short-circuit results;
- execute-callback failures including `WP_Error`;
- output-validation failures;
- successful completion.

The observer uses the common argument subset for the 6.9/7.0 before/after actions so its callbacks remain valid on both supported WordPress versions even though WordPress 7.1 adds the Ability instance as an extra action argument.

## Source and transport attribution

Direct PHP Ability execution is recorded as `transport=php` and source unknown unless another reliable integration boundary reports source metadata.

Generic REST Ability execution is `transport=rest`; REST alone is not AI or MCP evidence.

Generic WP-CLI execution is `transport=cli`; CLI alone is not AI or MCP evidence.

The official WordPress MCP Adapter is attributed automatically only when both of these are true:

1. the official `WP\MCP\Core\McpAdapter` runtime is loaded; and
2. the request is on its canonical default-server boundary:
   - HTTP endpoint `/wp-json/mcp/mcp-adapter-default-server`, or
   - WP-CLI command `mcp-adapter serve`.

That supports source attribution to the **WordPress MCP Adapter**. It still does not identify a provider/model/client such as ChatGPT, Claude or another agent unless a future adapter supplies reliable evidence for that identity.

## Public consumer API

The public v1 reporting boundary is:

`CB\Core\AIGovernance\Activity::record( array $activity ): string|false`

Use this only when a Core Blueprint extension or integration has governance evidence that is not already captured adequately by the WordPress Abilities observer.

Required keys:

- `operation` — stable operation identifier;
- `outcome` — one of `unknown`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `denied`, `invalid`, `short-circuited`.

Optional keys:

- `transport` — one of `unknown`, `php`, `rest`, `cli`, `mcp-http`, `mcp-stdio`, `reported`;
- `source_id`;
- `source_label`;
- `target_type`;
- `target_id`;
- `target_label`;
- `duration_ms`;
- `error_code`;
- `evidence` — bounded associative metadata;
- `context` — bounded associative metadata.

Example:

```php
use CB\Core\AIGovernance\Activity;

$activity_id = Activity::record( [
    'operation'    => 'my-plugin/content-operation',
    'outcome'      => 'succeeded',
    'transport'    => 'reported',
    'source_id'    => 'my-plugin-agent-adapter',
    'source_label' => 'My Plugin Agent Adapter',
    'target_type'  => 'post',
    'target_id'    => (string) $post_id,
    'evidence'     => [
        'approval_id' => $approval_id,
    ],
] );
```

The return value is the opaque activity UUID, or `false` when the report is rejected or cannot be stored.

### Public API rules

Consumers must not:

- reach into `Repository` or Base table internals;
- supply or spoof a WordPress actor/user ID — Base resolves the current actor;
- send raw prompts/responses/request bodies merely because they are available;
- label an unknown source as AI/provider/client based on heuristics;
- use the reporting API to replace domain authorization.

Consumer business authorization and permission checks remain owned by the consumer/domain operation.

## Admin surface and export

The Base-owned **Core Blueprint → AI Governance** page provides:

- an empty state when nothing has been recorded;
- date, actor, source, operation and outcome filters;
- activity list;
- per-record detail view;
- CSV export;
- structured JSON export;
- retention configuration.

The page and export actions require `manage_options` in v1.

Exporting activity and changing retention also emit normal Base Audit Log governance events so those administrator actions remain visible outside the dedicated AI Activity store.

## Failure behavior

AI Governance is an observability layer, not an execution policy engine.

An activity logging/storage failure must not be used to grant, deny or replace an Ability's permission callback. The reporting boundary is fail-safe/non-fatal and automatic observation treats storage as best-effort evidence capture.

## Out of scope for v1

AI Governance v1 does not include provider configuration, prompt/response archives, token/cost tracking, autonomous agents, approval workflow orchestration, policy enforcement, anomaly detection, Hub aggregation or heuristic AI detection.
