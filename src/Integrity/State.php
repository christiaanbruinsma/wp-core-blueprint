/**
 * State - subsystem master switch for Core Scanner.
 *
 * Single source of truth for whether the Core Scanner subsystem is
 * active. Read by the cron handler, the scan-starting REST routes,
 * and the admin page; written by the master-switch toggle endpoint.
 *
 * The `enabled` flag lives inside the existing `cb_core_settings['integrity']`
 * subkey alongside the per-feature toggles (plugin_checksums,
 * theme_checksums, uploads_scan, schedule). This keeps everything
 * Core-Scanner-related in one place. {@see ResultRepository::settings()}
 * merges the canonical defaults with stored settings so callers always receive
 * the complete public settings shape.
 *
 * The helper exists to centralise three concerns that would otherwise
 * leak into every caller: (1) reading the bool with a sane default,
 * (2) emitting an audit-log event on transitions, (3) syncing or
 * clearing the cron schedule when toggling. None of those should be
 * a caller's responsibility.
 *
 * Suite philosophy reminder: every CB subsystem should be deactivatable.
 * Operators may already have their own integrity scanner (Wordfence,
 * a custom solution) and Core Blueprint must not force itself on
 * them. Disabling here means: cron stops scheduling, scan-starting
 * REST routes return 403, the "Run Core Scanner" affordance disappears
 * - but baseline, history, and settings stay intact so toggling back
 * on resumes the previous configuration without data loss.
 *
 * @package Core_Blueprint
 * @since   1.0.0
