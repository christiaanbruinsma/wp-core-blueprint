/**
 * Contract for reporting scan progress.
 *
 * The ScannerEngine reports progress to a reporter at well-defined
 * lifecycle points. The reporter decides what to do with those signals
 * - write to a transient (UI feedback), drop them entirely (cron
 * runs), or anything else a future consumer might need.
 *
 * Mechanism (this contract) is decoupled from transport (transient,
 * SSE, websocket, audit-log). Lets us swap reporter implementations
 * without touching the engine.
 *
 * Lifecycle (sequential):
 *   start_phase('core', 2104)    → tick('core', 1)…tick('core', 2104) → complete_phase('core')
 *   start_phase('plugins', 25)   → tick('plugins', 1)…tick('plugins', 25) → complete_phase('plugins')
 *   start_phase('themes', 3)     → … → complete_phase('themes')
 *   start_phase('uploads', N)    → … → complete_phase('uploads')
 *   complete_scan('result-id')
 *
 * On failure anywhere:
 *   fail('error message')
 *
 * Implementations must be safe to call in any order - the engine may
 * skip phases (when settings disable them) and may abort early on
 * error. Reporters that track state (TransientProgressReporter)
 * handle out-of-order or skipped lifecycle events gracefully.
 *
