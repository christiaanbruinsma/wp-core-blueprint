/**
 * Bootstrap - wires the HUD subsystem into Core Blueprint.
 *
 * Called from {@see \CB\Core\Core::init()} alongside the Reports,
 * Permissions, Integrity, and Notes bootstraps. Registers:
 *
 *   - Brand registry (built-in CoreBlueprint brand, plus the action hook
 *     `cb_core_register_brands` that lets sibling/white-label plugins
 *     register their own brand implementations)
 *   - Default item registry (sections + items hook for siblings via the
 *     `cb_hud_register_items` action)
 *   - REST routes for state mutation (brand/position/ghost/visibility
 *     under `core-blueprint/v1/hud/*`)
 *   - Render hooks on `admin_footer` and `wp_footer` so the HUD chrome
 *     appears on every admin and frontend page where the user is allowed
 *     to see it
 *   - Asset enqueue on `admin_enqueue_scripts` and `wp_enqueue_scripts`
 *
 * Kill-switch:
 *
 *   The entire bootstrap honours an `cb_core_hud_enabled` filter - if it
 *   returns false the bootstrap returns silently before registering any
 *   hooks, REST routes, or render handlers. Equivalent to the subsystem
 *   not being loaded at all. Surfaces as a checkbox in Preferences ›
 *   Appearance via {@see Settings::is_enabled()}, which reads the
 *   `cb_core_hud_disabled` option and short-circuits the filter.
 *
 *   This is the operator's safety valve: if HUD ever conflicts with
 *   another plugin, breaks on a specific WordPress version, or is just
 *   not wanted on a particular site, one toggle in Preferences disables
 *   it without touching code, without deactivating the plugin, and
 *   without losing state - the user_meta keys (cb_core_hud_position,
 *   cb_core_hud_ghost, cb_core_active_brand) stay intact for next time.
 *
 * Frontend rendering:
 *
 *   HUD renders for logged-in users with the cb_core_hud_use capability
 *   on both /wp-admin/* and the public-facing site. The "front door"
 *   philosophy says the operator's launcher should be reachable wherever
 *   they're working - page builders run on the frontend, theme tweaks
 *   need to be checked in context, etc. Visitors without a session see
 *   nothing rendered (the render handler short-circuits before emitting
 *   any HTML).
 *
 * @package Core_Blueprint
 * @since   1.0.0
