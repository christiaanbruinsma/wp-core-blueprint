/**
 * BrandInterface - contract for HUD brand implementations.
 *
 * A Brand defines the visual identity that HUD presents on a given site:
 * the launcher button's logo, the panel's labels, the colour palette
 * tokens that override CB Base's defaults, and the human-readable
 * descriptions shown in the brand picker.
 *
 * The built-in CoreBlueprint brand lives under
 * {@see \CB\Core\HUD\Brand} and are registered automatically by
 * {@see \CB\Core\HUD\Bootstrap::register_brands()}. White-label and
 * sibling plugins implement this interface and register their brand on
 * the `cb_core_register_brands` action - see Bootstrap docblock for the
 * canonical usage example.
 *
 * Status states:
 *
 *   - 'available'   - fully implemented, selectable, applied immediately
 *                     when chosen from the brand picker
 *   - 'coming-soon' - visible in the picker with a "Coming Soon" badge,
 *                     the picker entry is disabled (click does nothing).
 *                     Use this when a brand's design is locked but the
 *                     supporting palette / theme variants aren't shipped
 *                     yet - the slot is reserved so users see the brand
 *                     is on the roadmap.
 *   - 'beta'        - selectable but flagged as not-yet-stable. Used for
 *                     brands with finished design but pending real-world
 *                     validation.
 *
 * Palette contract:
 *
 *   The {@see palette()} method returns an array of CSS custom property
 *   overrides keyed by token name. When a brand becomes active, those
 *   tokens are emitted on the `<html data-cb-brand="...">` element via
 *   inline style block, cascading to override CB Base's default tokens
 *   site-wide. Brand palettes should re-define core tokens (--cb-accent,
 *   --cb-success, --cb-surface-1, etc.) - anything not redefined falls
 *   back to CB Base's default value.
 *
 * Logo contract:
 *
 *   {@see logo_svg()} returns inline SVG markup (without surrounding
 *   <picture> or <img> tags) sized for the HUD launcher button - target
 *   intrinsic size is 24x24 to 32x32 viewBox, scales via CSS to the
 *   actual button dimensions. The SVG should be self-contained: no
 *   external references, no scripts, no embedded base64 (defeats
 *   caching). Use currentColor where possible so the brand palette's
 *   accent colour applies.
 *
 *   {@see logo_animated_svg()} provides an animated variant for the
 *   button hover/active state - same intrinsic size, may include CSS
 *   animations or SMIL transforms within the SVG. Returns the same as
 *   logo_svg() if the brand has no animated variant.
 *
 * @package Core_Blueprint
 * @since   1.0.0

	 *   slug  string  Theme slug - must match a key in Themes::all()

	 * Output is rendered server-side and inserted with no further
	 * escaping - implementations are responsible for their own escaping
	 * via esc_html() / esc_attr() / wp_kses() as appropriate. SVG
	 * markup MUST be sanitised through {@see \CB\Core\HUD\HUD::sanitize_logo_svg()}
	 * or an equivalent allowlist, never echoed raw.
	 *
	 * Default implementation in {@see AbstractBrand} renders a
	 * standard logo+label block; brands extending AbstractBrand inherit
	 * that default and only override when they need a different
	 * presentation.
