/**
 * Language - plain/technical rendering helper for log rows.
 *
 * Core Blueprint's logs run on two parallel tracks:
 *
 *   - Technical: raw event_type slugs ("system.plugin_activated"), HTTP
 *                methods + paths ("GET /status"), raw status codes ("200"),
 *                context JSON as key=value pairs. This is what an auditor
 *                or developer wants to see - unambiguous, copy-pasteable,
 *                machine-grep-able.
 *
 *   - Plain: human-readable sentences ("Plugin 'Yoast SEO' was activated",
 *            "Hub status check completed successfully"). This is what a
 *            care-home administrator or a municipal clerk wants to see -
 *            no jargon, no paths, same information but packaged readably.
 *
 * Data-wise, both tracks show the same thing. Technical details (duration,
 * source IP, actor, status badge) appear in both modes - the AVG-compliant
 * contract is "no information is hidden, only jargon is repackaged". The
 * only thing plain-mode strips is raw event_type slugs, raw endpoint paths,
 * and raw HTTP codes - replaced by equivalents the reader can understand
 * without domain knowledge.
 *
 * This class is the single source of truth for those equivalents. The
 * catalogs live here as class constants (EVENTS_PLAIN, ENDPOINTS_PLAIN,
 * STATUS_PLAIN) so adding a new event type or Beacon endpoint means
 * editing one file, not hunting through templates.
 *
 * Consumer pattern:
 *
 *     use CB\Core\Log\Language;
 *     use CB\Core\UI;
 *
 *     $mode = UI::current_mode(); // 'plain' | 'technical' | 'sync'
 *     $line = Language::describe_event( $row->event_type, $row->context_decoded, $mode );
 *
 * All public methods accept a mode parameter and return strings ready to
 * render. Missing translations fall back to the technical form - there's
 * no silent data loss if a new event type ships before its plain label.
 *
 * @package Core_Blueprint
 * @since   1.0.0
