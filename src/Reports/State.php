/**
 * State - subsystem master switch for Reports.
 *
 * Single source of truth for whether the Reports subsystem is active.
 * Read by the conditional admin-page registration in
 * {@see Bootstrap::register_admin_page()}, the AJAX guards on the
 * generate-report endpoint, the retention-pruner short-circuit in
 * {@see Storage::cleanup_expired_registered()}, and the master-switch UI
 * from the Dashboard; written by the shared module activation handler
 * `cb_core_set_reports_enabled` registered in
 * {@see \CB\Core\Ajax\Handlers\Reports}.
 *
 * The `enabled` flag lives directly under the existing
 * `cb_core_settings['reports']` array (sibling of `branding` and
 * `retention_days`). Defaults to `true` so installations predating
 * 1.3.26 silently inherit the prior behaviour - no migration needed.
 *
 * Suite philosophy reminder: every CB subsystem must be deactivatable
 * so operators can cover a given concern with their own tool of choice
 * (an external reporting service, a different report generator, no
 * reports at all on agency-internal sites that don't need them).
 * For Reports specifically, "off" means:
 *
 *   - Reports top-level admin menu item disappears entirely
 *   - The maintenance-report generate AJAX endpoint returns 403
 *   - The retention pruner short-circuits - old reports are not
 *     deleted while disabled, so re-enabling brings the historical
 *     archive back exactly as it was when disabled
 *   - Branding settings stay editable on the Preferences > Reports tab
 *     (activation is managed from Dashboard) so operators can prepare
 *     branding before re-enabling
 *
 * @package Core_Blueprint
 * @since   1.0.0
